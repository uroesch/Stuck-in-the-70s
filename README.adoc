= Stuck in the 70's?: Sanitize shell script from the disco era

This presentation is diving into bash features I do not usually encounter in the
wild. As a matter of fact most shell scripts are written without taking advantage
of the features introduced by Korn Shell in the early 80's and the Bash Shell
later in the same decade.

With Bash being ubiquitous throughout the Unix world there is little reason not to
take advantage of the more advanced features it provides. During the presentation
one learns how to make Bash scripts more predictable, less prone to errors an speed
up the execution time by using built in functions.
