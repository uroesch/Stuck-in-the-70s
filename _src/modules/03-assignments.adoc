[[assignments]]
== Operation plus equal

[.notes]
--
With Bash 3.1 the new assignment operator `+=` was introduced. 
It makes the previously cumbersome task of appending or adding content to 
an already populated variable a lot easier and DRYer.  
The following examples show the classical way and the new improved way.
--

=== Integer incrementation

[.notes]
--
There is a few ways incrementing integers in bash but the focus is on the `+=` 
assignment operator.
--

.Classical way
[source,bash]
----
counter=0
while true; do
  counter=`expr ${counter} + 1`   # declare -- counter="1"
  # [...]
done
----

.With `+=` operator
[source,bash]
----
declare -i counter=0
while true; do
  counter+=1                      # declare -i counter="1"
  # [...]
done
----

WARNING: Without declaring the variable as an integer the behavior
         is not as expected.

[source,bash]
----
counter=0
while true; do
  counter+=1                      # declare -- counter="01"
  # [...]
done
----

=== Append to string

[.notes]
--
The `+=` assignment operator acts differently when a string is
encountered.
--

.Classical way
[source,bash]
----
string="foo"
string="${string}bar"  # declare -- string="foobar"
----

.With `+=` operator
[source,bash]
----
declare -- string=foo
string+=bar            # declare -- string="foobar"
----

=== Push to array 

[.notes]
--
Using the `+=` assignment operator with a list or array
pushes a new value into an array.
--

.Classical list
[source,bash]
----
list="foo"
list="${list} bar" # declare -- list="foo bar"
----

.With `+=` operator
[source,bash]
----
declare -a list=( foo )
list+=( bar )      # declare -a list=(foo bar)
----

=== Summary

The `+=` operator helps with the assignment of existing and brings
a bit more comfort to the previously wordy and often times ugly process
of appending or incrementing numbers. 

WARNING: A `-=` assignment operator does not exist!
