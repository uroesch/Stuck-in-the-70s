== Errors, Shmerrors

[.notes]
--
Shell scripts are amazingly forgiving when it comes to bad coding practices.
Virtually every variable is globally available and can be used without being
previously declared.

Further, fatal errors in other languages result in the termination of the
script, not so in a classic shell script. Even after a problem the script
jugs along as if everything is dandy.

=== set -o errexit

[.notes]
--
The scripts I usually encounter do not exit on error. With this option set
the script is terminated when an error occurs.
--

.Script without `errexit` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

false
echo 'Still alive?' # Still alive?; exit rc 0
----

.Script with `errexit` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit

false               # exit rc 1
echo 'Still alive?'
----

To prevent exit on error, append `|| :` after the command.

.Prevent exit on error
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit

false || :
echo 'Still alive?' # Still alive?; exit rc 0

=== set -o nounset

[.notes]
--
Imagine a scenario where you remove a directory within a script where the last
part of the path is provided by a variable. For one reason or another said
variable is not defined and instead of the target directory you remove a lot
more than you bargained for.

`rm -rf /home/jdoe/${temp_dir}`

But don't dispair with `set -o nounset` this can be prevented.
--

.Script without `nounset` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm -rf /home/jdoe/${temp_dir} # rm -rf /home/jdoe/
----

.Script with `nounset` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o nounset

rm -rf /home/jdoe/${temp_dir} # bash: temp_dir: unbound variable; exit rc 1
----

=== set -o pipefail

[.notes]
--
When working with pipes per default only the right most command in the chain
is considered and checked for errors.

With `pipefail` each command within the pipe construct is evaluted.
This is especially useful for `awk` commands which generally return and
exit status of `0`.
--

.Script without `pipefail` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

find /fake-dir | awk '{print $1}' # exit rc 0
----

.Script with `pipefail` option
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o pipefail

find /fake-dir | awk '{print $1}' # exit rc 1
----

=== Summary

Always use the option triplet `errexit`, `nounset` and `pipefail` in your
scripts!

[.notes]
--
When refactoring an existing script add them first to see how far down the
rabbit whole the journey goes. If the script runs without a hitch the code might
not be as bad as assumed.
--

[source,bash]

#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail

ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

To disable the option for a certain block or command use `+o` instead of `-o`.

[source,bash]
----
[...]

# switch off exit on error
set +o errexit
false
# switch it back on
set -o errexit

[...]

[.notes]

NOTE: The options for `errexit` and `nounset` can be written as `set -e` or
      `set -u` respectively. But I prefer writing them out to help a novice user
      to better understand these settings.
