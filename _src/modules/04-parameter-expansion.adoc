== Substitution Revolution

[.notes]
--
Some may know the classical parameter expansion from Bourne shell such as 
`${parameter:N,N}` or `${parameter:-default}` or the ones from Korn shell
`${parameter%pattern}` or `${parameter#pattern}`. But bash has a few of 
its own. We look at three of them.

=== Modify case

There are two basic modes, the first is to convert the case 
of the first letter. The second is to convert the whole string.

[source,bash]
----
declare -- to_lower="ALL CAPS"
echo ${to_lower,}               # aLL CAPS   
echo ${to_lower,,}              # all caps

declare -- to_upper="all lower"
echo ${to_upper^}               # All lower
echo ${to_upper^^}              # ALL LOWER
----

NOTE: Requires bash >= 4.0

There is also the option of only matching a pattern to 
adjust the case.

[source,bash]
----
declare -- fruits="banana apple pear"
echo ${fruits^a}                # banana apple pear
echo ${fruits^[bp]}             # Banana apple pear
echo ${fruits^^a}               # bAnAnA Apple peAr
echo ${fruits^^[ae]}            # bAnAnA ApplE pEAr

NOTE: Requires bash >= 4.0

.Real world example
[source,bash]
----
if [ `echo ${string1} | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"` = "${string2}" ]; then  
  # [...] 
fi
----

.With parameter expansion
[source,bash]
----
if [[ ${string1,,} == ${string2} ]]; then  
  # [...]
fi
----


=== Substitution

This one really gets me! I almost never see `${parameter/pattern/}` 
substitutions in the wild. And is has been around for ages.

Given it is not as powerful as `sed` but for most use cases it is more than 
sufficient.

[source,bash]
----
declare -- string="lagoon racoon"
echo ${string/oo/u}             # lagun racoon
echo ${string//oo/u}            # lagun racun
----

.Real world example
[source,bash]
----
string="lagoon racoon" 
echo ${string} | sed 's/oo/u/g' # lagun racun
----

.With parameter expansion
[source,bash]
----
declare -- string="lagoon racoon"
echo ${string//oo/u}             # lagun racun

The script below loops 1000 times and does a string substitution with `sed` and then via 
the `bash` builtin substitution. The result is quite stunning. The builtin is is factors
faster.

.Example script `letter-substitution.sh`
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash 

set -o errexit
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail

declare -r TITLE="\nSubstitute 'o' for 'u' in string with '%s' a 1000 times\n"
declare -r STRING="lagoon racoon spoon loon"

function sed-loop() {
  printf "${TITLE}" 'sed'
  for i in {0..1000}; do
    sed 's/o/u/g' <<< ${STRING} &>/dev/null
  done
}

function builtin-loop() {
  printf "${TITLE}" '${var//o/u}'
  for i in {0..1000}; do
    echo ${STRING//o/u} &>/dev/null 
  done 
}

time sed-loop
time builtin-loop
----

.Results
[source,console]
----
$ bash letter-substitution.sh 

Substitute 'o' for 'u' in string with 'sed' a 1000 times

real    0m1.613s <1>
user    0m1.008s
sys     0m0.669s

Substitute 'o' for 'u' in string with '${var//o/u}' a 1000 times

real    0m0.020s <2>
user    0m0.020s
sys     0m0.000s
----
<1> `sed` takes about 8 times longer to complete the job
<2> Builtin is blazingly fast as it does not spawns a subshell for 
    every substitution.

=== Summary

Parameter expansion in shell scripts can be a bit cryptic at first but it 
is definitely a lot faster then to run a sub shell for every little change
made to a small string.

There are many more expansions available but the examples here are bash specific 
and won't work in the predecessor shells such as Bourne or Korn shell.
